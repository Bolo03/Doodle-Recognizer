Made by Bolohan Marian-Cristian

## What is this project?

This project is an implementaion of a convolutional neural network using PyTorch to classify images of doodles from 340 classes. The dataset used is from the [Quick Draw!](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) game and this project uses the `.npy` format of data to create smaller datasets.
Using the public dataset, other smaller datasets cand be created by following the `dataset_create.ipynb` notebook. After that, a convolutional neural network model cand be trained to classify doodles folowing the `model.ipynb` notebook.
